// m59-bt-delegation-test.mjs -- THE TEST THAT TELLS A DECOMPOSITION FROM A WRAPPER.
//
// A behavior-tree node that calls back into m59-autopilot.mjs has not replaced
// anything. The behaviour still lives in the monolith; only the call moved. That
// distinction is invisible to every other test in this repository, because a
// wrapper is behaviour-preserving BY CONSTRUCTION -- it passes precisely because
// it changed nothing. So a suite of green tests is exactly what a stalled
// migration looks like, and it is what this one looked like for forty commits:
//
//   ae350a2  m59-autopilot.mjs  11,909 lines   (before the BT effort)
//   a4a8eca  m59-autopilot.mjs  13,359 lines   (after 12,941 lines of BT modules)
//
// The monolith GREW by 1,450 lines during the project meant to retire it, while
// 613 BT assertions passed. Seventeen `_btFarm*`/`_btFlee*` methods were added to
// m59-autopilot.mjs to feed the trees -- new monolith code written to support the
// thing replacing the monolith. Nothing failed, because nothing was asking.
//
// This asks. `provisionNode` is the shape it exists to catch:
//
//     export function provisionNode(keeper) {
//       return asyncAction(async (bb) => {
//         const plan   = keeper._btFarmStrategy();
//         const result = await keeper.provision(plan, vitals(bb));
//         if (result === 'ate' || result === 'waiting') return SUCCESS;
//         return FAILURE;
//       });
//     }
//
// Three lines, all of them translating a legacy return value into a BT status.
// Delete `Autopilot.provision()` and this node stops working, which is the whole
// point: the delegation IS the dependency, and you cannot remove what is still
// being called. Every such call is a pointer back into the file you are trying
// to delete, and today there are 272 of them.
//
// ── THE SEAM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "Do not call the keeper" is too blunt to be true. Some coupling is correct and
// permanent, so the allowlist below is the actual architectural claim:
//
//   ALLOWED -- services. The keeper owns the session, the journal and the
//   configuration, and a node that could not report what it did would be worse,
//   not purer. `note`/`progress`/`noProgress` are the journal. `s`, `policy` and
//   `tally` are data, reached as properties rather than called.
//
//   REFUSED -- decisions and actions. `provision`, `travel`, `takeSafeSpot`,
//   `makeRoom`, `withdraw`, `safety`, `fightFloor`. These are the behaviour. A
//   node that calls one has not extracted it, and the extraction is the work.
//
// ── WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A RED BUILD ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Enforced absolutely this test fails on every file today, which makes it noise
// that gets skipped rather than a signal that gets fixed. So it is a RATCHET: the
// baseline records what each file owes right now, and the test fails only when a
// file gets WORSE. Wrapping is refused from today; the existing debt is paid down
// on its own schedule and can never quietly grow back.
//
// A file that IMPROVES also fails -- loudly, asking for the baseline to be
// lowered. A ratchet nobody tightens is just a comment.
//
//   node tools/m59-bt-delegation-test.mjs            # check the ratchet
//   node tools/m59-bt-delegation-test.mjs --queue    # the extraction work queue
//   node tools/m59-bt-delegation-test.mjs --bless    # rewrite the baseline
//
// Opens no socket, needs no broker, touches no fleet.
